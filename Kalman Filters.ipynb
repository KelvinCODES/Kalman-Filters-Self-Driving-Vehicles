    "In summary, given the only the first observed measurement of 1, the Kalman filter is unable to predict what the next location or velocity will be. This is because subsequent observations are needed to be able to estimate what the next point will be. Note that the variance is also still very high, as it is roughly our initial variance of 1000.\n",

    "With a second observed measurement of 2. The Kalman filter is able to predict that the next location is ~3 and the predicted velocity of the object to be 1. Which is correct. Note that the variance of the predicted next location and the predicted velocity drops drastically with a second observed measurement.\n",
    "\n",
    "With a third observed measurement of 3. The Kalman filter is able to predict the next location is ~4 and the predicted velocity is 1. Given the trajectory of the object, this is most likely the case. The variance of the predicted location and velocity is also alot lower then it was before.\n",

    "Something to note is that the variance will keep dropping as long as new measurements are coming in. This is because the multiplication of two Gaussians always cause the variance to be smaller. So this behavior we are witnessing for the observed measurements is correct."
